# Under major changes 
Recently I got to know about the policies enforced by my employer about the IP, techincally I do not own the IP of this project although I'd still be the author of this project. I got some good insights on the security side due to employer's involvement into monoSheet. There are few other features I'd like to add before marking the project as PROD ready.
### Please note that this still remains to be an open source project under the MIT license, as to respect the IP ownership I'll update the license agreement in a few days.

# Future updates in pipeline

1. "Me" filter for saved search filter baked into the integration.
2. Support for OAuth 1.0a
3. Support for OAuth 2.0 [Algos other than RSA]

### Overview

monoSheet provides a comprehensive solution to integrate NetSuite with Google Sheets using Google Apps Script and NetSuite RESTlet scripts. It enables users to fetch datasets and saved searches from NetSuite and populate them directly into Google Sheets for analysis and reporting. The solution leverages OAuth 2.0 authentication with JWT tokens for secure data transfer and includes caching mechanisms for optimized performance. A user-friendly HTML interface is provided for easy configuration of NetSuite credentials and report mappings.

### Setup and Configuration

#### NetSuite Setup

1. Deploy the provided RESTlet scripts in NetSuite:
   - `RS_getDatasetMetadata.js`: Fetches metadata about datasets and saved searches.
   - `RS_getDataset.js`: Retrieves data from datasets and saved searches.

2. Obtain the required OAuth credentials from your NetSuite account settings.

#### Google Cloud Setup

1. Configure Google Secret Manager to store NetSuite credentials in the specified format.

#### Google Sheets Setup

1. Open the Script Editor (`Extensions > Apps Script`) in your Google Sheet.
2. Copy and paste the contents of `appScriptGSheetDataPull.gs` into the script editor.
3. Add `nsUiConfig.html` as a new HTML file in the script editor.
4. Add two parameters - 'menuData' & 'nsConfig' to the script properties.
5. Save and close the script editor.

---

### Key Components

#### Google Apps Script

- **appScriptGSheetDataPull.gs**: Handles authentication, data fetching, caching, and UI generation within Google Sheets.
- **Functions**:
  - `onOpen()`: Initializes the custom menu in Google Sheets.
  - `showConfigurationDialog()`: Opens the configuration UI.
  - `getAccessTokenCached()`: Manages OAuth token retrieval and caching.
  - `getData()`: Fetches data from NetSuite and publishes it to Google Sheets.

#### NetSuite RESTlet Scripts

- **RS_getDatasetMetadata.js**: Retrieves metadata about datasets and saved searches.
- **RS_getDataset.js**: Fetches actual data from NetSuite based on user-defined parameters.

#### HTML Interface

- **nsUiConfig.html**: Provides a graphical interface for configuring NetSuite credentials and report mappings.
  - **Functions**:
    - `populateSecrets(data)`: Populates the secret configuration form.
    - `populateReportMapping(data)`: Displays report mapping configurations.
    - `saveSecrets()` / `saveMapping()`: Saves configurations to script properties.

### OAuth Scopes

Ensure the following OAuth scopes are enabled for the script to function correctly:

```json
"oauthScopes": [
  "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request",
  "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform",
  "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.currentonly",
  "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
  "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui"
]
```

---

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive `try-catch` blocks are implemented to handle potential errors.
- Errors from NetSuite API and Google Secret Manager are logged using `Logger.log` and displayed via `ui.alert`.

---

### Google Secret Manager Configuration

Ensure your Google Secret Manager stores the NetSuite configuration in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "pagestoload": "5",    // Minimum-0, Maximum-anything that restlet can handle within governance, but do note higher number = higher API response time
  "metadatascriptid": "NSMETADATASCRIPTID",
  "metadatadeployid": "NSMETADATASCRIPTDEPLOYID",
  "reportscriptid": "NSREPORTSCRIPTID",
  "reportdeployid": "NSREPORTSCRIPTDEPLOYID",
  "kid": "OAUTH2_CERTIFICATE_ID",
  "clientid": "CLIENT_ID",
  "privatekey": "PRIVATE_CERTIFICATE"
}
```
